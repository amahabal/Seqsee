=head1 NAME

SStream2 - A class for managing streams of thought
           
=head1 VERSION

This document describes SStream2 for revision $Revision$

=head1 SYNOPSIS
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each instance of this class manages a single stream of thought. Seqsee
currently only ever uses a single stream, but subsequent extensions
are likely to require multiple streams. The single stream that Seqsee
has is stored in the variable C< $Global::MainStream >.

=head2 The purpose of a stream

This is best described in chapter 5 of the dissertation, which deals with context. The last few thoughts (currently 10, as stored in the attribute C<MaxOlderThoughts>) form the context in which subsequent thoughts are understood.

Ideas relevant to this discussion include the notions of the fringe and the action fringe. A far more detailed description of these ideas can again be found in chapter 5.

=head2 How it works

Each entry in the stream satisfies the interface C<Thought>.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

SStream2 requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This module will probably undergo the greatest amounts of change when I start working on the next version of Seqsee. Here are some of the changes to be expected:

=over

=item _is_there_a_hit currently returns a single matching thought. If there is any match whatsoever, something is returned. With this return value, the codelet AreRelated is always launched. _is_there_a_hit should instead return a smart value which will be sensitive to the type of the match and the level of the match. Currently, the type of the match is very crudely approximated by the method thoughtTypeMatch.
