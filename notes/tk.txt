* Use Tk::Carp for sure
* Use Tk::Getopt also. Excellent module!

* Perhaps also Tk::FireButton

* possibly Tk::LabFrame( with option -label)

=====================
* LABELS:
  Probably a label with an image too :)
  Useful reliefs: (default/flat) Probably what I'll use most	
  For image, perhaps 'sunken' will be good
  -bitmap another useful option; Builtins include qw{error hourglass info questhead question warning TK}

====================
* BUTTONS:
   Maybe with icons (see iconic button demo in widget())
===================

* MessageBoxes should be used more frequently

* MENUs

Learn to use Tk::ConfigSpecs.... could be useful
