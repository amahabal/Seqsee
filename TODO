*** Other Blemishes
  ---> to ensure I have not hardcoded many assumptions
  ---> other blemishes that take arguments, like "repeat"
  ---> Explore whether and how I may compose() by default

*** Other Positions
  ---> "the 3" or "the length 3"
  ---> "after the peak", "after the 3"

*** Other categories
  ---> what I used to describe as literal categories, like "1 2 3"
   ---> should not be hard, and also, needed for "the 3" and "the 123"
  ---> could give a completely new look and feel to is_blearily_ok
     ---> but I may still need something more literal like 
	  is_blearily_ok around.

*** SBuiltObj
  ---> I really need to resolve the plethora of structure commands

*** Test::Seqsee
  ---> consider splitting this up
  ---> ensure uniformity in naming conventions

*** THINKING
  ---> changes cannot be decoupled from descriptions
    ---> write millions of examples and represent change/desc pairs
  ---> Current describe is pretty brute-forcish
    ---> thoughts on how the stream can be brought to bear?

*** ANOTHER REFACTORING ROUND!

*** Blemishes applied at several places ("everywhere", "somewhere")
*** Fascinations. 
*** Roll a release. Today, now!
*** Clean up tests. More tests absolutely needed. Did I say clean up?
*** Composing meta-categories?
