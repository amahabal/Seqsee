This is going to be a huge list...

* I should maybe work on the workspace for a bit. Lots of stuff there that can be lifted to this new environment.

* Need to create groups.

* Write a lot of examples including descriptions, bonds, groups etc.

* Create class SObject (from which SElement and SGroup derive), and add stuff to this like promote/add/remove bonds and groups, and add similar functionality to the WS.

* Write as_str() methods for the various classes.
