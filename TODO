*** A little unrelated: consolidate my four pmwiki installations to two: 
public and private. Or maybe even 1, with a read password on part of the 
group of one. This is probably best!

*** Quite a bit of moving code around may be needed.

*** Other Blemishes
  ---> to ensure I have not hardcoded many assumptions
  ---> other blemishes that take arguments, like "repeat"
  ---> Explore whether and how I may compose() by default

*** Other Positions
  ---> "the 3" or "the length 3"
  ---> "after the peak", "after the 3"

*** Other categories
  ---> what I used to describe as literal categories, like "1 2 3"
   ---> should not be hard, and also, needed for "the 3" and "the 123"
  ---> could give a completely new look and feel to is_blearily_ok
     ---> but I may still need something more literal like 
	  is_blearily_ok around.

*** SBuiltObj
  ---> I really need to resolve the plethora of structure commands

*** Test::Seqsee
  ---> consider splitting this up
  ---> ensure uniformity in naming conventions

*** THINKING
  ---> changes cannot be decoupled from descriptions
    ---> write millions of examples and represent change/desc pairs
  ---> Current describe is pretty brute-forcish
    ---> thoughts on how the stream can be brought to bear?

*** ANOTHER REFACTORING ROUND!

*** Blemishes applied at several places ("everywhere", "somewhere")
*** Fascinations. 
*** Roll a release. Today, now!
*** Clean up tests. More tests absolutely needed. Did I say clean up?
*** Composing meta-categories?

*** Perl6! Get a bunch of these things working in perl6. Should be absolutely doable!


**** AFTER DISCUSSION WITH DAVID
* Elusis?
* Bug: 1 1 2 3/ 1 2 3 3 4/ 3 3 4 3/ 5 5 6 7 6 5
* Explanation of why I cannot get at some pressures and how gennext would be a good place for that
* Build up (two parts, where the first is a mountain), as well as down.
* The user input can use parentheses to group things together. The easiest, and will do a lot to get harder things to happen. So many more categories that I can get at. A MUCH MUCH larger set of derived categories would become available.
* I should write code for this today, perhaps. But No: I'll wait, plan a bit more and then do it. But the friday deadline for shipping this code is fast approaching!
