*** Put the CGI scripts unver SVN... I tried using symlinks, but that does not seemed to have worked very well. Hard links, perhaps?

*** Namespace for categories and blemishes to love in
  --> right now I am having to do way too much work to refer to these categories.
  --> perhaps something like $S::ascending or $S::double would be appropriate!

*** Load order cleanup
  --> that is another thing fully capable of becoming a headache

*** Quite a bit of moving code around may be needed.

*** Other Blemishes
  ---> to ensure I have not hardcoded many assumptions
  ---> other blemishes that take arguments, like "repeat"
  ---> Explore whether and how I may compose() by default

*** Other Positions
  ---> "the 3" or "the length 3"
  ---> "after the peak", "after the 3"

*** Other categories
  ---> what I used to describe as literal categories, like "1 2 3"
   ---> should not be hard, and also, needed for "the 3" and "the 123"
  ---> could give a completely new look and feel to is_blearily_ok
     ---> but I may still need something more literal like 
	  is_blearily_ok around.

*** SBuiltObj
  ---> I really need to resolve the plethora of structure commands

*** Test::Seqsee
  ---> consider splitting this up
  ---> ensure uniformity in naming conventions

*** THINKING
  ---> changes cannot be decoupled from descriptions
    ---> write millions of examples and represent change/desc pairs
  ---> Current describe is pretty brute-forcish
    ---> thoughts on how the stream can be brought to bear?

*** ANOTHER REFACTORING ROUND!

*** Blemishes applied at several places ("everywhere", "somewhere")
*** Fascinations. 
*** Roll a release. Today, now!
*** Clean up tests. More tests absolutely needed. Did I say clean up?
*** Composing meta-categories?

*** Perl6! Get a bunch of these things working in perl6. Should be absolutely doable!
