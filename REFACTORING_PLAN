Goal: Slowly remove genlib.

How: For classes modified by compiling, one by one copy the compiled 
version onto the original, and do any appropriate cleanup, refactoring.  
The new version will be unmodified by compiling.  When compiling ceases to 
do any work, we can replace genlib/ by lib/.
  
Goal: Remove dependance on Class::Std
  
How: Slowly migrate to Moose.  For some classes, this will be easy, for 
others, less so.  However, I have some tools to ease the transition.
