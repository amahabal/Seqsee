Seqsee is a cognitive science project whose immediate goal is to create a program that can extend integer pattern sequences. Version 1.0 is expected to be released in the summer of 2008.

The longer term goal is a program that is extendible to other domains. By version 2.0 (no date yet, but certainly no earlier than 2009), it should be possible to adapt the program to a wider range of cognitive tasks.

Seqsee is written in Perl, and will be ported to Perl 6 when that lands.
